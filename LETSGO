Possible strat for fixing ist: save-excursion, insert space, go back one char, check for comapany, if so leave excursion, ...
Fix how ISM completes after I'm done spamming tab on a yasnippet

fix all warnings in site lisp files as well
elec-pair.el:582:7:Warning: misplaced interactive spec: ‘(interactive (list
    (or current-prefix-arg (quote toggle))))’

BIND:
goto-line
hs-hide-stuff

run emacs tests

add a couple more lines to xref to obtain more context

I'm going to have to unbind all keys in said module in order to see the true defaults....

make sure to font lock all modes appropriately

man pages still open up in new frame........................

change to just (make-sparse-keymap)

properly comment and document/describe everything

go over John DeBord functions and make sure they are looking good

customize the color of `` faces and allow parenthesis and/or anything; possibly make it act as mini-code snippet looking thing
also customize th face of #define ASDF

fix search and replace ivy

[ ] Configure:     GO OVER ALL CONFIGURATION FILES AGAIN AND LOOK AT/PLAY WITH ALL OF THEIR CORRESPONDING API's.
                   (in particuluar counsel looks like it has alot of good stuff)
                   - Customizable group variables; set them all accordingly in their respective files
                   - Look for similar functions that I can replace with these said better ones that I find in the APIs
                   - Optimize/refactor/properly replace the functions I've defined (ist/isd/etc.)
                   - Go through keymaps once more (including comint) (when rewriting them this time, include, within
                     the `setcdr' logic the keymap with the default bindings themselves, but with those bindings commented out);
                     this time edit their functionality at the site-lisp level (on a fork of emacs along with byte
                     compilation scheme/fonts for maximum portability (include other dotfiles)
                   - I can't insert a '*' in eshell
                   - (normal and esoteric C/C++ formatting variables set (templates/lambdas/ switch/etc.)))
                   - (MAKE sure to separate out the references to third party/outside stuff into their respective
                     settings files, or else if I will need to ack and search around for it aimlessly until I find all instances)
                     (PREFACE all modified standard functions that I have modified with comments/etc.)
                     
[ ] Functionality: All compilation warnings and Emacs startup warnings
[ ] Functionality: Theme (including modeline formatting stuff)

[ ] Standardize:   _ postfix for locals; one space to separate logic; two spaces in between functions; document
[ ] Standardize:   for site-lisp: same as above and remove autoloading
[ ] Standardize:   only one hook call
[ ] Standardize:   setq, defun, other funcs (in alnum)
[ ] Standardize:   functions everywhere
[ ] Standardize:   no more add advice overrides anywhere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just replace the code
[ ] Standardize:   progn all the functions
[ ] Standardize:   `` notation
[ ] Standardize:   Figure minor mode initialization with either t or 1

At the end of this weekend, I want to have a pristine devel environment
With everything fixes and spruced up
That way, until the end of the year, I want to just be polishing my environment and setting up a consistent setup on a VM

dev environment
math
c++ books
c++ implementation
core and experimentation
specialize/research papers
