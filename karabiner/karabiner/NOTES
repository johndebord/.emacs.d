- `left-gui`-`q` quits the current window in chrome, I might have the modify that in the future
- Instead of modifying just a select few keys: `{w,r,t,a,s,z,x,c,v}`, I might have to modify them all to follow the same pattern in the future

- At the moment I can only `left-alt`-`tab` and not `shift`-`alt`-`tab` due to some caveats of Mac and using Karabiner Elements; modify in the future if need be
- The application "Show Desktop" doesn't hide Telegram for some reason
- There are a few mundane things that should be done for an optimal environment (scripts on start/wake, better organization of keybinds, alt-tabbing into windows that
  are minimized, etc.), but these will have to wait for another time.
