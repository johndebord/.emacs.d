Possible strat for fixing ist: save-excursion, insert space, go back one char, check for comapany, if so leave excursion, ..uu
Fix how ISM completes after I'm done spamming tab on a yasnippet

Script logic:
(Test on Windows VM)
====================
Must have auto tools and stuff to build emacs; so get those
checkout emacs-26
Run auto-gen in root emacs dir
mkdir emacs-26
cd emacs-26
../configure
make

Ensure that it is a certain version of linux mint.
Install git.
Possibly install gdb.
Possibly install clang.
Possibly install llvm.
Possibly install chrome.
Possibly install ack/dependencies.
Possibly install fd/dependencies.
Possibly install ...
Clone my repository which contains:
  emacs fork
  font
  .emacs.d
  .bashrc
  .config stuff?
Open up emacs.
Byte compile all files.

[ ] Configure:     GO OVER ALL CONFIGURATION FILES AGAIN AND LOOK AT/PLAY WITH ALL OF THEIR CORRESPONDING API's.
                   (in particuluar counsel looks like it has alot of good stuff)
                   Must have a setup script to be good to go on any virtual box
                   - Customizable group variables; set them all accordingly in their respective files
                   - Look for similar functions that I can replace with these said better ones that I find in the APIs
                   - Optimize/refactor/properly replace the functions I've defined (ist/isd/etc.)
                   - Go through keymaps once more (including comint) (when rewriting them this time, include, within
                     the `setcdr' logic the keymap with the default bindings themselves, but with those bindings commented out);
                     this time edit their functionality at the site-lisp level (on a fork of emacs along with byte
                     compilation scheme/fonts for maximum portability (include other dotfiles) (try a more stable version
                     for the super long custom box bug that I find very annoying) (I can't insert a '*' in eshell
                     (try a more stable emacs version)) (normal and esoteric C/C++ formatting variables set (templates/lambdas/
                     switch/etc.))) (MAKE sure to separate out the references to third party/outside stuff into their respective
                     settings files, or else if I will need to ack and search around for it aimlessly until I find all instances)
                     (PREFACE all modified standard functions that I have modified with comments/etc.)
                     
[ ] Functionality: All compilation warnings and Emacs startup warnings
[ ] Functionality: Theme (including modeline formatting stuff)

[ ] Standardize:   Proper hooks for initiating minor modes in major modes (look at how I use `company' for an example)
[ ] Standardize:   Convention for ordering defvar/defun/etc. in files
[ ] Standardize:   Decide to use lambdas or actual functions everywhere
[ ] Standardize:   Decide to fset or defadvice the chosen functions
[ ] Standardize:   progn all the functions
[ ] Standardize:   Decide what to macrotize
[ ] Standardize:   Predicates should all end in `-p`
[ ] Standardize:   Comments should use the `` Markdown notation
[ ] Standardize:   Figure minor mode initialization with either t or 1
