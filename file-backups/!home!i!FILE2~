Welcome back again where it all began
Open are the ports. Services all started.
Knock at every door and grab the missing strings
Put them in a row and crack the code to win

Scanning close the files may reveal some things
Data you can't hear. Data you can't see.
Scattered are the clues all around the disk
Some are in plain sight some you need to think

Check your mail for messages, log on IRC
Feeling old already? Oh I bet you did.
You will need some tools, look around for hacks
Talk with all the daemons hiding in the dark

Now don't be afraid. It's a simple game.
All you need are memories buried in your brain
For it's in the past where you need to start
Surfing like a pirate. I wish you good luck.
