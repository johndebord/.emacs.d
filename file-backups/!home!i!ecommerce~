It seems as if making big money using ecommerce goes like this:
- Make a solid website with a with an elegant and intuitive UI (perhaps experiment to find which ones are popular and template it)
- Find a niche product
- Purchase a marketable domain name
- SEO your site in creative ways (trying to get in other people's shoes to find out what they would probably search for)
- Then when they place an order on your site
- Simply reroute their order from Alibaba to them where you keep the difference

It seems as if a big key to these kinds of things is to find products where you have large margins

I could probably write a script to find the most niche/up-in-coming products via Twitter and other social media,
and then pick the top ones; automatically do some research on the margins/plausability of the product, and then execute it well.

Another key takeaway from this is to analyze the tools given (in this case Alibaba/Amazon) and come up with a creative idea that can leverage said tool.

My next question is: what will be the next evolution of this to be one of the first to get in?
Will Alibaba/Amazon someone prevent this from happening?
Something like: Walmart offers grocery pickup; make site to advertise delivering groceries; make a few round trips based off of that in time-slots; good to go.

that certain thing happens?
