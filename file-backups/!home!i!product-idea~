Package together a sample website that's super simple with `.tk` extension with default tools.
Charge like $99 for a blank canvas. $149 to set it up with email rerouting. $199 for basic site. $299 for basic site with shopping functionality.
*Make sure in the contract that it says I'm not responsible for domain name providers dropping hosts, data limits, and traffic hard-stops.
*I should also provide a service where I preemptivily plan people wanting to migrate their whole site to a `.com` domain with monthly fees for hosting.
