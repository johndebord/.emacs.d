Manual Reading Questions for Xah:
1) Why should I not read reference manuals cover to cover?
2) How to effectively skim a reference manual?
   Just read the first paragraph?
   Read the function forms but skip over their details, or just read the first paragraph describing
   the implementation of the function?
3) What lessons have you learned over the years from reading reference manuals?
   Do you have any tips/tricks?
4) When you say, "Just get the general idea", what exactly would you constitute as the general idea?
5) For example, I'm currently reading the Emacs Lisp reference manual. Would you recommend diving
   into the C source code?
6) What exactly do you mean in your article when you say, "When you have time to read the reference manual
   cover-to-cover then you can". But isn't that contradicting what you're saying in that you shouldn't
   read reference manuals cover-to-cover? Can you elaborate on that?
7) Can you give a quick example on how to skim a chapter in a reference manaul?
8) After skimming the Emacs Lisp reference manual, should I also skim all of the standard stock
   Emacs Lisp files that come with Emacs in directory `/usr/share/emacs/25.2/lisp`?
Thank you.
