The Intel 64/IA-32 processors are little-endian.
*What does the "IA" mean here?

There are reserved bits; be mindful of them; their behavior is undefined.
*What is an example of one of these reserved bits?

LABEL    MNEMONIC ARG1,ARG2,ARG3
--------------------------------
LOADREG: MOV      EAX,SUBTOTAL

There are only up to three arguments.
Intel 64/IA-32 processors follow the convention: `LABEL: MNEMONIC DEST,SRC`

Note the postfix character for hex representaion:    `FFFFH`
Note the postfix character for binary representaion: `1010B`

Memory can be split in segments of the given address space.
Identifies byte `0xFF79` in the data segment:                                                      `DS:FF79H`
Identifies an instruction in the code segment; `EIP` register contains the address of instruction: `CS:EIP`

Page fault exceptions example: `#PF(fault-code)`
