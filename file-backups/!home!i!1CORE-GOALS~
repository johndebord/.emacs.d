[ ] My capstone project should be a blockchain in Emacs Lisp.
    It will be a different blockchain in that it can only be accessible via Emacs (I'm not
    sure how I'm going to accomplish this). But it will be fun, because a person will be able
    to interact with it via all of the features that Emacs has. The resulting native currency
    should be Ecoin or EmacsCoin; something of that nature (possibly based upon the FSF
    principles to mine the native cryptocurrency if so decided).
    It should work as an Emacs Lisp library (or possibly extension); this is so that anyone
    curious can simply build/install Emacs and be able to browse and look upon the current
    state of the network (that would be cool). In my introduction, I should state something
    akin the following: "I never received a bachelors degree. I'm not even sure if I have an
    associates degree---I've never checked. But after completed OSSU, I'm seeking validation
    that I am, now in fact, a computer scientist."
