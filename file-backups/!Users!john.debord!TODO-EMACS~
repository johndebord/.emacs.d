[ ] Add keybinds for common unicode characters
[ ] When resizing a window, add the functionality for the text to scale down/up instead of
wrapping around the screen
[ ] When looking at files of arbitrary size, I like to be able to see the entire file by splitting
the file evenly into vertical tabs. Thus create a script that automatically does this for me;
splitting the tabs with excellence whilst keeping it understandble to me (e.g., keeping the
bottom portion of the page).
Just as well, maybe it could possibly be a minor mode; where the background shifts color
gradually on the way down the buffer. So that when the vertical tabs are split, I will be able
to recognize where I'm at in the file by seeing the underlying background behind the text.
This could possibly make it faster for me to figure out where I am in the parrallel tabs?
[ ] Have yasnippet macros where I can easily type in different color outputs to print to the
terminal. I could also possibly have different macros set up to construct a quick GUI.
