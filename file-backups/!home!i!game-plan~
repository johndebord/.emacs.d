Among other things, I've been going hard studying the foundation EOSIO (let
along blockchain tech in general) ---  the database.
This weekend I'll be trying to finish the book ...
Also, if you know of any resources that could cut the learning curve or
would give me any "AHA" or insight that you found really helpful, please let
me know. If not, then that's ok. I feel like I'm progressing at a good pace.
