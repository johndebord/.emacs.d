Take the C++ community as a prime example.
Many people have hard-forked the core language to fit their desires.
But why is it that all forks have never gained traction?
I see a couple reasons at the moment:
1) C++ is so darn useful.
   It's just too good, that any other fork of the language seems inconveniant in 99% of situations.
2) C++ has a steadfast community.
   There are so many tutorials, references, guides, tools, etc. that jumping in is a menial task.
