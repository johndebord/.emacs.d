|10|  - | 5|  = 5
| 5|  - |10|  = 5

|-10| - |  5| = 5
|  5| - |-10| = 5

|10|  - |-5|  = 5
|-5|  - |10|  = 5

|-10| - | -5| = 5
| -5| - |-10| = 5

10 - (-5) = 10 + 5 = 15
5 - (-10) = 5 + 10 = 15

#0 Explain (50/10) in layman's terms

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1 Explain difference between -10 and 50 (abs) such that the difference is 60

------------------------------------------------------
#2 Explain (2*(-3)) such that (-3)(-3) or (-2)(-2)(-2)
Google Search: Why does a positive times a negative equal a negative?

------------------------------------------------------
#3 Explain (6/(-2)) such that (-3)(-3) or (-2)(-2)(-2)
Google Search: Why does a positive divided by a negative equal a negative?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#4 Explain the associative property, commutative property, and the distributive property

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#5 Explain how the prime factorization of two numbers gives the least common multiple of said numbers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#6 Explain how cross-reducing makes logical sense when multiplying factions

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#7 Explain how multiplying two fractions answers the questions, "what is a/b of c/d"?
   Intuitively you would think this would relate to division; not multiplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#8 Explain how to divide fractions by hand without multiplying and its logic thereof
   Graph these in an area example
   What is a better way of saying (4 / 1/2) "Give me n number of groups of halves"?
   Explain each case graphically:
   - 10 * 15
   - 10 / 15
   - 1/10 * 15/10
   - 1/10 / 15/10
   How is 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12?
   Why does lining up the decimcal point in division problems work?
   Explain how we can't do the problem (10 * 2 / 2 * 1) in any order any why that doesn't work from first principles
   Why doesn't subtraction and division have the commutative and associative property?
   Unit cancelations and converting ft/meters/hours/seconds stuff
   Why does cross-multiplying work?
   How are multiplication and division related when it comes to: total/number of groups/size of groups?
   Gain an intuition on multiplying/dividing decimals/fractions of all cases/variants
   Memorize all basic terminology: "product", "quotient", "equation", "expression", etc.
