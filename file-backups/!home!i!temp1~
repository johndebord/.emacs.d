Hey Auntie Karen,
I like new job.
I know Phillip is moving.
Congratulations on marriage.
I plan on coming up.

Hey Auntie Karen,
Things are going pretty well here.
I get to learn something new every day. So that's a huge plus.
And it's going to be real interesting to see how the technology I'm working with is going to help shape the world in the future.
Me and Phillip talked about a month or so ago, and we want to make plans to hang out one of these days in Florida; that would be a lot of fun.
I think I will be in Grand Rapids around early June because Grant is getting married to Taya. It's either in June or July.
Love you and miss you Auntie Karen!
